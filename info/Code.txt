// When running diffs, be sure to put the older version as DIR1 and the newer version as DIR2

// Run the git diff algorithm on two arbitrary directories and output the resulting info to an outfile
git diff --no-index --name-status DIR1 DIR2 > out.txt

// Run a general diff, ignoring .DS_Store, on two arbitrary directories
// This will also error on bad symlinks and the like, but we don't care about these
// This is more for verifying that two backups are identical or not
diff -x '.DS_Store' -x '._*' -rq DIR1 DIR2

// Find all instances of empty folders, since sometimes I would use empty folder names to explain things instead of files, but git doesn't pay attention to folders directly
find DIR -depth -type d -empty
